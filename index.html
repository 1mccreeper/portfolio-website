                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I currently study at Georgia Southern University in the Allen E. Paulson College of Engineering and Information Technology. I use projects like this site as a way for me to familiarize myself with new languages and techniques. Many of these projects may have gone unpolished or never reached a stage at which they could be published, but the practice and techniques I've learned from them are still invaluable. I hope to use this site as the beginning to showing more of these projects as they reach more finished stages. Following that, I would appreciate any criticism or advise from anyone who feels they could help.</p>
